# heart_rate_monitor
Heart rate monitor designed in KiCad, using Nordic NRF51822 bluetooth module and TI AFE4400 heart rate module.

The repository contains a KiCad design of a 5x5 cm heart rate monitor breakout board. Some libraries were borrowed from Guan Yang's github projects (https://github.com/guanix/boards). Also, some design aspects of the circuit were inspired by HackManhattan Nordic nrf51822 beakout board (http://dangerousprototypes.com/2013/05/19/hackmanhattans-nordic-nrf51822-breakout-board/)
